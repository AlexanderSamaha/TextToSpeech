About:
  
  This application was made during the 6 hour McMaster Engineering Competition on October 20th 2018. This was created in collaboration       with 3 other peers.
  
  The goal of this application was to create a text to speech GUI using the tk module for a person suffering from Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and is unable to communicate by speech. This would allow the person to string together multiple words with some pre-set phrases and access to an on-screen keyboard. Using a python package pyttsx, the string created would be passed through the text to speech engine for more natural conversation.
  
  
  Had idea for emergency contact button which would send out an SMS from a user's phone to a target phone with a predetermined message.     Not implemented as of October 21st 2018.
